A tree is a special type of graph in which we can reach any node from any other node
using some path that is unique, unlike the graphs where this condition may or may not
hold.

A tree is an undirected connected graph with N vertices and exactly N-1 edges.

A tree does not have any cycles in it, while a graph may have cycles.

A loop is an edge that connects a vertex to itself

In a complete graph (where each node is connected to every other node by a direct edge), there are NC2 number of edges means (N * (N-1)) / 2 edges

A digraph or directed graph is said to be strongly connected if and only if there exists a path between every pair of nodes in the graph.

The adjacency matrix of an undirected graph is symmetric.

The memory use of an adjacency matrix for n nodes is O(n^2), where n is the number of nodes in the graph.

BFS uses a queue as an auxiliary data structure to store nodes for further processing, the DFS scheme uses a stack. 
both these algorithms make use of a bool variable VISITED

Applications of Breadth-First Search algorithm

● Finding all connected components in a graph G.
● Finding all nodes within an individual connected component
● Finding the shortest path between two nodes, u and v, of an unweighted graph.
(The shortest path is in terms of the minimum number of moves required to visit
v from u or vice-versa).

For getting the number of connected components in a graph, the number of
times we need to call DFS/BFS traversal for the graph on an unvisited vertex gives the number of connected components in the graph.

A bipartite graph is a graph which can be coloured using 2 colours such that no adjacent nodes have the same colour.
